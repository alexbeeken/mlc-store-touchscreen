# Mono Lake Committee Store Touch Screen

This is an Ember app that is displayed in the Mono Lake Committee store in Lee Vining, CA.

You can see a (soon to be working) example [here](mono-lake-changing-levels.herokuapp.com). You might use google Chrome's device toolbar and set the screen resolution to 1024 x 768 if the page looks broken. Responsive sizing is a lower priority because the app was built for a single device.
